<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Written in React</h1>

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React. You can play the game in your web browser. This README file explains how to deploy the game on your local machine.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Before you can deploy the game, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

<div>
<ul>
<li>Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)</li>
<li>Git (optional, but recommended)</li>
</ul>
<div>

<h2>Installation</h2>
To install the game, follow these steps:
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:<br>
    git clone https://github.com/username/tic-tac-toe.git <br>
    Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your machine.</li>

<li>Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the source code.</li>

<li>Install the dependencies by running the following command:</li><br>
    <b>npm install</b>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2>Running the Game </h2
  To run the game, follow these steps:

  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the source code.</li>

  <li>Run the following command to start the game:<br>
     <b> npm start</b></li>
  <li>To play the game, click on a square to make a move. The game will automatically detect if someone has won or if the game is a draw.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
<h2>Building and Deploying the Game</h2>
  To build and deploy the game to a production server, follow these steps:

  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the source code.</li>

  <li>Run the following command to build the game:<br>
     <b>npm run build</b></li>
  <li>Deploy the contents of the build directory to a web server of your choice. You can use any web server that supports serving static files, such as         Apache or Nginx.</li>
  <li>If you want to serve the game on a specific port, you can use a package like serve to serve the build files:<br>
    <b>npm install -g serve <br>
       serve -s build -l 3000</b></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

This will start a web server on port 3000 and serve the game from the build directory.
